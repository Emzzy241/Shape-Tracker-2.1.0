    // Next: Testing the Private static field _instances through its getter and setter method GetAll()
    
    // Twelfth Test: Identifying the simplest possible behaviour the program must exhibit which is: creating our private static _instances field along with its getter method, GetAll()

      // Our test still failed
      //Well, the issue is not obvious... In fact, our code and test are written perfectly, and the issue is in our tests: because the tests will run in order, by the time it gets to our final GetAll test, we've already many, many Triangle objects to our static list â€” 11 to be precise!

      // Remember that each time a new Triangle object is created by the constructor, the entire Triangle class has a new object added to its static List of Triangle objects. We can't reset the static list unless we manually clear the list (like with a static ClearAll() method)! So, when our GetAll test runs, it compares the expected list of 3 triangles with a list of 14 Triangle objects (11 from the previous tests and 3 from the GetAll test).

      // Well, we can solve this issue with a teardown method that will clear out _instances between each test. Let's learn how to do that in the next lesson!
      // To forcefully pass this test, we can comment out all of our previous tests and leave only the Last one(GetAll()), thats an awful way to solve the issue. Lets learn a new concept that will help us solve the error
